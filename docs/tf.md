# About Text-Fabric

Text-Fabric, developed by [Dirk Roorda](https://github.com/dirkroorda), is a powerful Python-based software package accessible at [https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric), designed to provide accessibility to a wide range of ancient texts and linguistic annotations for both programmers and non-programmers alike. By treating texts and annotations as data in a table-like format, Text-Fabric maintains the integrity of the original text structure, enabling comprehensive analysis and exploration of these valuable linguistic resources.
